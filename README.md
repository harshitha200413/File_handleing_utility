DESCRIPTION:

File handling is a fundamental feature in Java that allows developers to create, read, write, and modify files stored on a computer. This capability is essential in various applications, from saving user data and reading configuration files to generating reports and handling logs. The objective of this utility project is to design and implement a Java program that demonstrates basic file operations on text files. These operations include reading content from a text file, writing new data to a file, and modifying existing file content. The program is accompanied by clear documentation and comments that make it easy to understand and adapt for different use cases.

Java provides several classes and methods for file handling, primarily from the java.io and java.nio.file packages. To read data from a file, the program utilizes BufferedReader along with FileReader, which allows for efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. The file-reading function is designed to open a specified text file, read its contents line by line, and display them on the console. This helps users understand what data the file currently holds and whether any changes are needed. For improved usability, the program handles exceptions such as FileNotFoundException and IOException, ensuring that errors are communicated clearly without crashing the program.

For writing to a file, the program uses BufferedWriter in combination with FileWriter. The user can specify whether to overwrite the existing content or append new data to the file. This flexibility is crucial for real-world scenarios where sometimes data needs to be preserved, and other times it needs to be replaced. The write function prompts the user to enter the text they wish to store, then writes it to the designated file. If the file does not already exist, it is created automatically. The writing process is followed by a confirmation message, enhancing user experience.

Modification of file content is slightly more complex and involves reading the file into memory, altering the required portions (such as replacing a word, editing a specific line, or appending content), and writing the updated content back to the file. This is done using a combination of file reading and writing logic, along with string manipulation techniques. By breaking the process into distinct steps, the program maintains clarity and modularity, making it easier to debug or extend with additional features in the future.

Throughout the script, ample comments and documentation are provided to explain each part of the code, including the purpose of variables, methods, and exception handling blocks. This makes the program especially suitable for beginners learning Java or developers looking for a reusable file handling template. The utility demonstrates how to perform essential file operations in a real-world context, making it a valuable tool for data management, log handling, and user-generated content processing.

In conclusion, this Java-based file handling utility showcases how to read, write, and modify text files effectively. With clear documentation and a structured codebase, it serves as both an educational resource and a practical application, reflecting the power and flexibility of Java's file I/O capabilities.
